## ðŸ§  Model Overview

* Deep learning approach using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks
* Input features include weather variables and air pollutant levels
* Separate models trained for:

  * 1-step ahead prediction
  * 24-step ahead prediction (1 day)
  * 48-step ahead prediction (2 days)
* Scalers and encoders saved to disk for consistent preprocessing

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

* `baq_dataset.csv`: Final dataset containing weather & air quality features

---

## ðŸ§ª Experiments & Results

* Trained on hourly data
* Evaluation metrics include MAE, RMSE, and R2
* Visualizations include prediction vs. ground truth line charts
